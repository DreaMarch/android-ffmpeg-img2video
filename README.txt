About this Project
------------------

This project is based on https://github.com/guardianproject/android-ffmpeg,
thanks for his great contribution.

We demonstrate how to convert a series of images into a video in this project.
So enjoy it and feel free to ask me (wani420@gmail.com)! 

How the Project Works
---------------------

1. Use the ffmpeg binary generated by https://github.com/guardianproject/android-ffmpeg
2. Save the ffmpeg binary and testing images to app internal storage.
3. Use java runtime execution to run ffmpeg command, the command is as follows.
(ffmpeg -r 24 -i "img%05d.png" -i test.wav -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p -s 640x480 -shortest out.mp4)
